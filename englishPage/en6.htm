                With China's growing international influence, more and more international students are studying in China. Calligraphy, Peking Opera, tai chi; Ching Ming festival wear hanfu, Dragon Boat Festival bag dumplings; Go to a number of cities to investigate, to poor mountain areas to teach...
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as Chinese students learn more about traditional culture, Chinese universities are trying to create opportunities for international students to perceive China in a multi-dimensional and comprehensive way, and to feel the goodwill and hospitality of the people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every year, more than 6,000 students from over 130 countries and regions are studying in east China normal university. Adhering to the concept of "applying diplomacy in daily life and combining management with service", the school has achieved fruitful results in the field of international education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Huang meixu, director of the international education center at east China normal university, told chinanews.com on Thursday that international students are different from Chinese students in traditional customs and cultural backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Huang Meixu tells a reporter, in the general situation of China, Chinese culture, such as curriculum, a chance for international students to in-depth understanding of contemporary Chinese history, culture and social development, the promotion of China's identity at the same time, the school also to carry out the "second classroom" social practice, encourage students to experience the textbook knowledge, insight into the Chinese local conditions and customs, folk culture, the real "experience China".

                Nuria, from kyrgyzstan, is a junior majoring in international Chinese education at east China normal university. She told reporters that in kyrgyzstan, China, with its long culture and rapid development, is increasingly attractive and many people want to know about the real China. 'every subject in the school gives her a different perspective on traditional Chinese culture,' she says. Visiting Confucius' hometown in qufu of shandong province and searching for traces of zhuge liang in hanzhong gave her a more real feeling of the extensive and profound Chinese civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shanghai and the Yangtze river delta region is one of the fastest growing Windows in China and the closest to the world. East China normal university creates opportunities to bring international students closer to a more authentic Chinese society. According to huang, the school has established good cooperative relations with many primary and middle schools in inland underdeveloped regions for a long time, sending more than one batch of outstanding international students to "love supporting education" every year.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is understood that the charity support education not only enables international students to better understand the objective status quo and causes of unbalanced development in east and central China and its causes, but also enables them to experience the hardworking, warm, kind and positive mental outlook of Chinese people in their contact with ordinary rural people.

                Uyang ge from Mongolia graduated as an undergraduate this year. When she was in college, she was deeply impressed by her experience in jiangxi as a volunteer teacher. Uyang says she teaches local children to sing and dance, and is touched by their simple kindness. The young Mongolian girl says the volunteer village gives her a glimpse of different aspects of China and allows her to experience Chinese society more comprehensively.

                German student majishan is a doctoral candidate studying Chinese party history. After taking part in the volunteer teaching activity, he wrote in his essay: "I have a deeper understanding of China. Unsophisticated, to develop the countryside - wuyuan, is also China." "" through supporting education in primary and secondary schools in wuyuan, I learned about the governance model of China's grassroots."

                The friendship between nations lies in the people's blind date, and the people's blind date lies in the mutual heart. To this end, the east China normal university encourages international students to go out of the campus and bring international culture into the surrounding communities. It is learned that, for many years, every week foreign student volunteers to the surrounding primary and secondary schools to teach Chinese children culture courses. Yayi ishi, an undergraduate from Japan, visited the temporary care center regularly to accompany the orphans.
            </p>
            <p>
                International students who understand Chinese culture and feel the real Chinese society become "ambassadors" who spread Chinese culture and love. It is understood that many international students who have participated in the volunteer education have been working hard to improve the teaching and living conditions of children in mountainous areas for a long time. Some organizations love charity sale activity and so on. Wade, an exchange student from the United States, saved money for his study after returning to China.

                In the interview, she told reporters that in the future, she will be a Chinese teacher when she returns home, so that more people can learn Chinese and understand the charm of Chinese culture. She said she will share her learning and life experiences in China with more people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wu yangge, who is about to become a master's student in tourism management at east China normal university, will go back to China every holiday to teach children Chinese. 'every time I go back to China, a lot of people come in and ask about China,' she said. 'a lot of people express their desire to learn Chinese.' Wu Yang ge is always happy to share her experience of studying abroad at east China normal university, as if she is the "ambassador of China" in her hometown. (after)
