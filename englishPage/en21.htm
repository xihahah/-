            </p>
            <p>
                2. Scope of subsidy
            </p>
            <p>
                In view of the fact that the working and living conditions of rural teachers in the three prefectures of southern xinjiang are particularly difficult, the autonomous region, on the basis of the current policy of subsidizing rural cadres at the grass-roots level, has raised the living allowances of rural teachers in 24 counties and cities of the three prefectures of southern xinjiang. The specific scope is as follows:
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Kezile sukirgizi autonomous prefecture: atushi city, aktun county, aheqi county, ucha county.
            </p>
            <p>
               3. Objects and conditions of subsidy
            </p>
            <p>
                Rural public primary and middle schools and kindergartens in the southern xinjiang sandizhou rural area (including special post teachers within the service period of three years), specifically refers to the southern xinjiang sandizhou urban areas, counties outside the rural teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following persons do not enjoy living subsidies for rural teachers:
            </p>
            <p>
                (1) the grade of the last year's year-end assessment is unqualified for on-job teachers;
            </p>
            <p>
                (2) teachers who are warned, demerit, demoted or removed from professional and technical posts for violation of professional ethics and political discipline;
            </p>
            <p>
                (3) absent teachers (including absent teachers due to secondment, transfer, long-term medical leave, etc., except those who are out on duty);
            </p>
            <p>
                (4) retired teachers;
            </p>
            <p>
                (5) teachers who support education in rural schools but have been subsidized by the "special plan for teachers under the talent plan of the three regions" of the autonomous region.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Implementation principles of subsidies
            </p>
            <p>
                (1) it shall be paid on a monthly basis. Life allowance is decided according to post, every work on post of rural school (kindergarten) job teacher can enjoy, and life allowance is paid by the month. Those who leave the post of rural school (kindergarten) will cancel the living allowance from the next month.
            </p>
            <p>
                (2) distinguish standards and highlight key points. When providing living subsidies, we should always give preferential treatment to schools (kindergartens), small villages and teaching centers in remote townships, towns with difficult conditions, and mountainous townships. The autonomous regional finance will allocate funds to counties and cities according to the standard of 200 yuan per teacher per month. In formulating the standard of living allowance, counties and cities do not adopt equalitarianism, and factors such as the distance of transportation and the hardship of living conditions of local rural teachers should be taken into account comprehensively. In principle, standards should be divided into three levels: 300 yuan, 200 yuan and 100 yuan.
            </p>
            <p>
                (3) open and fair, sunshine operation. When implementing living subsidies, subsistence allowances, scope, object, conditions, grade standard, through the local education department, newspapers, websites, and facilitate the public knows the way, such as school public bar according to the annual fair show, and set up the superintendent to report telephone and online report mailbox, to accept the complaints from teachers, the whole process of supervision by the society.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Sources and allocation of subsidy funds
            </p>
            <p>
                The funds needed for rural teachers' living allowances shall be coordinated by the central and autonomous regional governments. The autonomous region government will allocate funds for rural teachers' living allowances to counties and cities, which will be arranged in line with local conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Requirements
            </p>
            <p>
                (1) the financial department of the three prefectures of southern xinjiang should pay high attention to, strengthen organization and leadership earnestly, formulate specific implementation plans based on the actual situation, and report to the department of education and department of finance of the autonomous region for the record.
            </p>
            <p>
                (2) for rural teachers who enjoy living subsidies, the annual statistics of teacher real name system in autonomous region shall prevail, and the real name system shall be administered. Rural teachers living subsidies shall be directly distributed to the personal pay card account of teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                (3) strengthen the propaganda work of rural teachers' living subsidy policy, make full use of local media, adopt various ways, actively publicize the policy, strengthen the guidance of public opinion, and strive to create a good atmosphere for the whole society to pay attention to rural education and care about rural teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                (4) strengthen the management and supervision of rural teachers' living subsidy funds, so as to achieve special use of special funds. After the financial department of the autonomous region allocated the subsidy funds to the county and city, the county and city shall allocate the subsidy funds to the teachers in a timely manner, and shall not be detained, occupied or misappropriated for any reason, so as to prevent the occurrence of false report, false claim and withdrawal of subsidy funds. The department of education and the department of finance of the autonomous region will carry out an irregular inspection on the use of special funds in various regions. For counties (cities) that fail to implement the rural teachers' living subsidy policy according to the requirements, or that are detained, occupied or misappropriated special funds, special funds will be recovered or deducted according to the situation, and criticism will be reported.
            </p>
            <p>
                (5) before the end of January each year, relevant prefectural education and financial department shall report the implementation of rural teachers' living subsidies to the education department and finance department of autonomous region through the "information reporting platform for rural teachers' living subsidies".
            </p>
            <p>
                (6) pay attention to improving the supporting mechanism of rural teachers' team construction. We should take comprehensive measures to improve the quality of rural teachers. Teacher training should be inclined to rural teachers and improve their participation rate. It is necessary to establish the rotation and exchange mechanism for teachers in counties (cities and districts) to promote the scientific and orderly flow of teachers. We should improve the system of supporting rural schools by urban school teachers, and regularly send urban teachers to rural schools as volunteers. The evaluation of teacher's position (title) is inclined to the rural and remote school teachers. We will effectively increase the proportion of senior teachers' professional titles in schools located in towns and villages and below, and schools in cities and towns shall not occupy posts of senior teachers' professional titles in schools located in towns and villages and below. Urban primary and middle school teachers should have more than one year of teaching experience in rural schools or weak schools when evaluating senior positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                (7) these measures shall be implemented from January.
            </p>
            <p>
                (8) the present measures shall be interpreted by the department of education and the department of finance of the autonomous region.
