            <h2>The first stage</h2>
            <p>
                From 1996 to 1999, it was the first period of rapid development of supporting education for college students in China. During this period, the Chinese government and the central committee of the communist youth league jointly promulgated a series of supporting education policies and carried out a series of supporting education activities, which led to the first upsurge of supporting education for Chinese college students..
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1996, the communist youth league central at the central civilization office, ministry of education, the ministry of health, ministry of science and technology, the ministry of agriculture, ministry of personnel, the western development office of the state council and other departments, began to pilot "youth volunteer relay for poverty alleviation plan", through open recruitment, regular rotation, insist for a long time relay mechanism, organization to mobilize the youth volunteer issue for poor areas to provide six months to two years of basic education, health care, agricultural science and technology promotion services.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1998, in order to further the implementation of the general office of the general office of the central committee of the CCP, the state council on forwarding of the CPC central committee organization department, the national education committee, the ministry of personnel (from party and government organs and institutions send personnel to support the basic education of instruct) notice hair (1996 -) in the (23) spirit, make the teaching solid relay for poverty alleviation plan implement effectively, according to the instruction from the central leadership, the central government and the communist youth league central since 1998 in the national comprehensive promotion "youth volunteer teaching in poverty alleviation relay plan". This project organizes young volunteers with a certain level of education to work in poor areas for one to two years, education in primary school, and volunteer in science, technology, culture and medical care. By the end of December 2007, the country 30 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government), city, district and organs directly under the central government to organize and implement the plan, a total of nearly 300000 urban youth voluntary application has to send the 17751 youth to the west, including Tibet, 19 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) to carry out the service, service counties in 237, has formed in the developed areas to support underdeveloped region and the eastern and western counterpart support two modes as well as education, health, two pillars for poverty alleviation project, An organizational implementation and management mechanism including recruitment, training, dispatch, daily management, evaluation and financing has been formed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1999, the central committee of the communist youth league and the ministry of education jointly organized and implemented the "postgraduate support group", a Chinese youth volunteer poverty alleviation relay program. From 1999 to 2007, nine graduate support groups have been successfully established successively. A total of 2,906 graduates qualified for admission as graduate students have been recruited from 83 key universities in China to carry out one-year volunteer service in 76 poor counties (cities) in 20 provinces (cities and districts) in central and western China. From 1996 to 1999, the Chinese government and the central committee of the communist youth league jointly promulgated a series of supporting education policies and carried out supporting education activities. We can also see that in 1996, supporting education for college students was only a part of the "youth volunteer relay plan for poverty alleviation", which was attached to supporting education for young volunteers at that time. However, the establishment of the "postgraduate support group" in 1999 marked that the supporting education of college students began to appear on the stage of supporting education in China as their own independent status, and also reflected China's constant attention to supporting education of college students. In the first stage of voluntary teaching for college students, although it has been carried out nationwide, the concept of voluntary teaching for college students has not been formally formed, nor has it been proposed separately. The concept of supporting education for college students is formed and put forward in the second stage of supporting education for college students.

            </p>
            <h2>The second stage</h2>
            <p>
                From 2003 to 2005, it was the second rapid development period of volunteer teaching for college students in China. During this period, the Chinese government and the central committee of the communist youth league issued two major policies, which pushed the support education for college students to the second climax.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2003, the communist youth league central committee and the ministry of education, ministry of finance, ministry of personnel of the notice on the implementation of western college students volunteer service plan (middle mediatek [2003126) regulation, according to the open recruitment, voluntary application, organized selection, centralized dispatching approach, to recruit 5000-6000 ordinary institutions of higher learning graduates, in the western poverty-stricken villages and towns in the period of l_2 to education, health, agricultural extension, poverty alleviation, and youth center construction and management of volunteer work. Once the policy is put forward, to cause the attention of the masses of college student volunteers, In addition, an upsurge of college students' volunteer teaching in the west and service in the west was set off in China, and the concept of college students' volunteer teaching began to be formally formed. College students' volunteer teaching began to become one of the popular words in the current society, and began to receive more and more attention and attention from the society.

            </p>
            <p>
                In 2005, for the implementation of the general office of the general office of the central committee of the CCP, the state council about the opinions of the guide and encourage college graduates to the grass-roots employment "hair (2005) in the (18), the central organization department, ministry of personnel, the ministry of education, ministry of finance, the ministry of agriculture, ministry of health, poverty relief office of the state council, the communist youth league central decision, organized to carry out the college graduates to the grass-roots grass-roots engaged in teaching, agriculture, health and poverty alleviation work, referred to as the" three helps "plan. The plan calls for recruiting 20, 000 college graduates a year for five consecutive years starting from 2006, according to the methods of open recruitment, voluntary registration, organization selection and unified dispatch. The proposal of "three supports and one support" policy is the first time for China to make a clear statement on supporting education for college students in national policy, which also indicates that "supporting education for college students" has been recognized and supported by the Chinese government.
