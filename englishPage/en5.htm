            <p>
                The word "supporting education". Zeng xiangduan, song yueqi and li zhen, who teach in chai damu primary school, are the representatives of the support teaching team from the graduate support group of yanshan university. They use practical action to practice the teacher, supporting the development of chaidamu education career heart, mission..
            </p>
            <p>
                
Go west
            </p>
            <p>
                In response to the call of the central committee of the communist youth league and the ministry of education, yanshan university launched the graduate student support group project for young volunteers in China in September 2016, and established the graduate support group of yanshan university for the first time. In July last year, the first graduate student support group volunteers came to the primary school department of the second secondary school of delingha city for a one-year volunteer service. The first graduate student support group consists of three members: zeng xiangduan, school of vehicle and energy, yanshan university; song yueqi, school of electrical engineering, yanshan university; and li zhen, school of environment and chemistry, yanshan university.
            </p>
            <p>
                In July 2017, with dreams in mind, they bid farewell to the picturesque land of yanzhao and came to delingha, a new town on the plateau, to become a member of the teaching team of qaidam road primary school, and embarked on a one-year journey of supporting education in the western region.
            </p>
            <p>
                When they walked up to the platform and faced the students' expectant eyes, they realized that there was still a lot of work to be done to truly realize the transition from students to teachers. For this reason, on the one hand, they humbly asked the old teacher for advice. They not only carefully prepared lessons and made lesson plans, but also tried to solve all possible problems and solutions in front of them. Therefore, the first lesson was well presented. In order to get better training, they not only serve as the main course, but also shoulder the teaching tasks of science, ideology and morality, physical education and other courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first challenge they faced, from zero to the 2,980m (2,980m) altitude, was the severe altitude sickness of headaches, sleeplessness and breathing problems. Quite a few students write to them, and the desire for scientific knowledge and the expectation for these teachers from other countries make them feel at home in different places. Students' trust is the biggest motivation. As a volunteer teacher, they will make up their mind. Only by constantly improving their comprehensive ability can they ensure their all-round growth in morality, intelligence, physical fitness and physical beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
                The west needs us more
            </p>
            <p>
                In the teaching of education, the support group put students' interests first and resolutely put education first. The volunteer teachers are responsible for math, science, ideological and moral courses in grade one and grade four, covering 600 students. During the period of supporting education, the group helped two poor students to complete the "one-to-one subsidy". During the period of study, each student could get 1,500 yuan of subsidy every year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zeng xiangduan is responsible for teaching math tasks for class 6, grade 4. When we interviewed zeng xiangduan, he was in class. When the reporter came into the classroom, he saw that students were enthusiastic in answering questions, and the interaction between teachers and students was full of joy. Although the school bell kept ringing, the children were still "pestering" zeng xiangduan
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking to reporters, zeng said: "when I first got here, it was not as bleak as we expected. Although the city was small, it was clean, clean and functional. I love this town."
            </p>
            <p>
               "Zeng's lecture style is humorous and good at combining the practical life teaching, which makes the boring math knowledge very attractive. The key and difficult problems should be explained several times, and the homework should be corrected in person. He is used to explaining wrong questions in class, and after class he is just like our friends." Fourth grade class six class monitor Chen fuying said excitedly.
            </p>
            <p>
               "Children in the western region are more eager for knowledge. I am determined to support education in the northwestern region and use what I have learned to contribute to the development of education in the western region, so as to give back to the society and realize my own value." Support teacher song yueqi told reporters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, the students in this class did not like to do the expansion of the subject, disliking this way of thinking rigid, more unwilling to break through their own. Song yueqi adopted a progressive teaching method, which enabled them to gradually develop the good habit of self-conscious learning. "" as long as the children have a little bit of transformation, I am happy for them because good study habits will accompany them all their lives," "song said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Li zhen was originally recommended to go to nankai university for further study by the school. When he heard that the support group went to support education in northwest China, he made the decision to support education in northwest China. He said: "there was a bit of a struggle because school places were scarce, but when I thought of the western children's eager eyes for knowledge, I thought the northwest needed me more and should do something for the children. Every day in class, I feel very happy when the children call me their teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Since they volunteered to teach, they often took time to help their children with their lessons while teaching new lessons, which greatly improved their academic performance. They have a wide range of knowledge and a lot to learn. Chai damu road primary school teacher child embroidery told reporters.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the process of solving problems and consolidating knowledge, they are getting closer and closer to children. Although the children are small, but the emotion is exquisite, they pay to the teacher's sweat they are more see in the eye, also remember in the heart, and will be grateful to the three teachers, into their handicraft lesson made peach, art lesson picture...........
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go to the west, to the grassroots, to the most needed places in the motherland", for the teachers in yanshan university, is no longer a slogan, but also a growing force, to urge the young people to move forward!
