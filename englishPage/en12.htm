        <h3>Xu zhihong: college students should have strong policy support</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-push-2 col-md-8 col-md-push-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-push-2">
            <div class="NewsTime">Source: Chinese net 2009-01-12</div>
            <p>
                <b>Chinese network news</b>  On the morning of December 26, 2008, the sixth session of the 11th NPC standing committee divided into groups to review the report of the NPC standing committee's law enforcement inspection team on the implementation of the compulsory education law of the People's Republic of China. Xu zhihong, a member of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, said during the deliberation that I made several comments on the inspection report on compulsory education law enforcement. In recent years, the implementation of compulsory education law has been inspected by the National People's Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I agree with the members' suggestion that the commitment to obligation education should be increased. From the perspective of building a harmonious society and improving national quality, China's basic education has great influence on China's future development. Education is a very important aspect to reflect social equity, which should be paid great attention to and determined to increase investment to the basic education of rural and poor areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, the construction of teachers. The problem of teacher team, actually all kinds of schools exist, the scale of higher education is greatly expanded, the whole country also lacks a large number of high-quality university teachers. Education is what the state has to support. In the planned economy under the conditions of relative is not a problem, at that time, the national key university graduates assigned to yunnan, Tibet and other remote areas also went to, now want to two-way choice, even many capital cities of university graduates are not willing to go at the grass-roots level, so we must consider the new situation how to motivate this part of the young people to the grassroots. When I was studying at Peking University, I advocated going to the border area. Everyone obeyed the state's arrangement. Besides, I should say that the treatment was also good. The current situation is that we have made great achievements in the past 30 years of reform and opening-up. However, the gap has widened greatly due to the market mechanism, so I think we should attach great importance to this issue. The first step is to make the teachers' treatment in rural remote areas equal to that of local civil servants as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, the scope of free normal university students. Last year, the ministry of education stipulated that some teachers' colleges and universities directly under the ministry of education should offer some majors free. I think it was for solving the teachers may just have a symbolic role, because our primary and secondary school teachers is the main source of the provinces, cities and regions of normal colleges, not the ministry of education in the middle of several normal colleges, the past of the normal universities mainly training high-level faculty, and as large parts of China, so I suggest that the normal universities should focus on the province and even region, especially in the western region, the normal universities should accelerate the implementation of the measures, which can make our western teachers to have a stable source as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fourthly, the supporting education for college students should be supported by strong policies. I see Peking University to be a teacher in around recently, Tibet, yunnan, we are to retain the graduate student, let him go down one or two years, your workout, still can be returned to the school as a graduate student, I think this part of the students in primary school exercise after come back a lot of harvest, as college students to rural primary and secondary schools to teach a course is should not have too big problem, as long as he has this spirit. I think similar experiences are worth summarizing, because in school, relatively speaking, it is better for a college student to graduate and the environment for them to exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                He said that big cities can be modelled on universities and that primary and secondary schools in developed regions can pair up with those in the west. The ministry of education launched a project several years ago. Some key universities funded by the ministry of education paired with western universities. For example, Peking University mainly supported xinjiang shihezi university and improved their education research level. Whether the primary and secondary schools can adopt a similar approach, we launched the coastal primary and secondary schools and the inland primary and secondary schools to implement "one gang one" to solve the current situation that the teaching staff cannot keep up. Now the city does not worry about the source of middle school teachers, I know that some middle schools in Beijing have one or two hundred students applying for a vacancy, and many graduates of key universities apply, so for large and medium-sized cities, the main problem is how to solve the problem of basic education balanced development in the city. I've watched some high schools as a principal over the years, and some have deviated from education's. Many key middle schools have better conditions than universities, some classrooms and dormitories have air conditioning, and none of us in Peking University have air conditioning. This development further drives the differences in hardware and software between different middle schools. I also agree with some members' remarks that we should give more support to the weak and poorly based middle schools in cities. (lie)
