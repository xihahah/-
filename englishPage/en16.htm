            <p>
                When we talk too much about supporting education, it will change our taste. What we have to say about supporting education is what others do not know. Speaking of supporting education, I want to talk about the memory that is still clear in my heart: if I can change your fate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The origin of the incident, say back to 2012 to support the post teaching. I choose to be a volunteer teacher. After experience, we know that the "real combat" on the "battlefield" is not the same as the operation when teachers teach us to learn in the normal classroom. For example, not all students will finish the assignment. For example, ninth graders have already begun to idle away their time in preparation for social work. For example, these students have different personalities than you think...
            </p>
            <img src="../img/p6_1.png">
            <p>
                Those of us who have never been exposed to real teaching regard teaching as the lifeblood of the classroom. Yet we spend 100% of our time teaching children who do not enjoy listening to lectures.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, we teach very hard, they did not learn, both lose.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is such a "disobedient" boy in the class of seventh grade that I teach. Besides Chinese, I never write the homework of each subject. Besides Chinese, I never listen carefully in class.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I criticized him once, no matter how honest I was with him, he didn't want to tell me why he was so "naughty" in class. As the deputy head teacher of their class, I felt the pressure and the "provocation" from students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then one day, he began to ask me English questions, and my English study became very good. I was surprised. Although I still do not know why, I did not ask. Maybe, during the six months I spent with them, some words and some behavior had influenced him. He was accepting me and accepting himself just for his own sake.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still remember that the ninth grade English teacher contacted the ninth grade of the senior class because of her pregnancy and vacation. At that time, the ninth grade was different from my junior three. I thought that only a few people did not study.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's right, one or two of them, I was on the stage that day, talking about life events, life is not as simple as they are, making money is not easy, society is complicated...
            </p>
            <p>
                At that time, I was a young girl with a baby calf. To the society, I was also a young grass, but not so young compared to them. And I resemble very much seven old teach a gentleman of 80 years old, a sermon, although they are in the audience various hip-hop joke, each kind of play card crack melon seed...
            </p>
            <p>
                At that time, I was particularly eager: when they were still young, I met an extremely responsible teacher, who told them what was right and what was wrong, took fewer detours in life, and added more colors to the future. And then I found out I was wrong, way wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children's future is in their own hands, in their own minds, what we can do is to put ourselves in their shoes for them, stand in their perspective and talk to them about you in the third day, and their hope for the future. People are not born for less detours, some detours are necessary to walk, you walk yours, I walk mine, there is always meaning and value to walk.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I stopped thinking: if only I could change your life. In the teachers' handwriting, we should not expect to change students' fate and their life path. Living and learning on their existing basis has become a form, and we are more likely to bring them our views and attitudes about the world. I think this should be the best gift. (write/cao yufang)
