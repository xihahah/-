        <h3>Liu hongyu suggested strengthening policy support for education public welfare: students can not settle after supporting education</h3>

            <div class="NewsTime">2017-03-09 14:18:00　Source: thepaper.cn (Shanghai)</div>
            <img src="../img/t9.png" title="全国政协委员刘红宇">
            <p>
                The generational transmission of poverty is largely due to the lack of a second day education. During the two sessions this year, "education poverty alleviation" was included in the government work report for the first time. Liu hongyu, a member of the CPPCC national committee, submitted to the fifth session of the 12th national committee of the CPPCC (CPPCC) a proposal on Canada university's policy support for education voluntary teaching volunteers (hereinafter referred to as "proposal").
            </p>
            <p>
                In an interview with thepaper (www.thepaper.cn), liu hongyu said that many people now believe that teachers are the most scarce in poor areas, while education public welfare organizations such as beautiful China have done a remarkable job in making up for teachers, "which is a very important supplement to teachers."
            </p>
            <p>
                However, what restricts the development of education is the lack of effective policy support in addition to the funds. Hong-yu liu pointed out that in the "proposal", many people in the long-term teaching project public welfare organization recruit fresh graduates, volunteers not only at the end of the service period without any reward, also faced the loss of the fresh unripe qualification and cannot settle such difficulties, therefore, hong-yu liu suggestion, according to "China youth volunteer ZhiJiaoTuan poverty alleviation relay planning students" or "western college students volunteer service plan" the support of policy, strengthen the education of public policy support of the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The volunteers faced a series of difficulties after they finished their service</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hong-yu liu is put forward in the "proposal", in recent years, the education of public organization to flourish, education public welfare organization obviously increase the number and also more detailed work areas, from the previous personal spontaneous, these sort of subscription, short-term, until now the emergence of more and more public welfare organization rooted in poor areas, sending full-time teachers engaged in a line of basic education teaching work, according to the special case of each area each school, continue to carry out precise education poverty alleviation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Liu hongyu, for example, cited beautiful China, an influential public welfare program, as an example. Since its establishment in 2008, beautiful China has selected more than 1,000 volunteers for two years to teach full-time in mountainous areas, benefiting more than 330,000 students. In the academic year of 2015-2016, nearly 350 volunteers were selected to go to the poverty-stricken mountainous areas for full-time volunteer teaching for two years, benefiting tens of thousands of students and making a lot of efforts to improve the current situation of education in poverty-stricken areas. In addition, according to incomplete statistics, there are hundreds of similar education public welfare organizations in China, which send a large number of volunteers to education resource weak and poor areas for long-term teaching activities.

            </p>
            <p>
                She also pointed out in the proposal that what restricts the development of education public welfare organizations is the lack of effective policy support in addition to the funds. Many charitable organizations that have been involved in long-term teaching programs recruit mostly new graduates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking beautiful China as an example, among the volunteers selected in the 2015-2016 academic year, 80% of them are fresh graduates, most of whom are from famous universities in China. After two years of experience in front-line teaching, most of them will grow into excellent grassroots teachers. Volunteers work two years, however, at the end of service period, they do not have any reward, not only is also facing a series of difficult: because teaching in two years to lose the fresh unripe qualification and cannot settle, take an examination of civil service does not recognize volunteers at the grass-roots level in teaching in the last two years work experience, because hard teaching lead to one's deceased father grind preparation time rush often have to fight for a few points... In this situation, education has virtually built a barrier for public welfare, which makes many students with ideals hesitate, forced to give up public welfare and restricted the development of education public welfare.

            </p>
            <p>
               <b>It is suggested to strengthen policy support for education public welfare organizations</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Proposal", according to begin from 1999, the central, the ministry of education jointly organize the implementation of the Chinese youth volunteer research raw ZhiJiaoTuan relay for poverty alleviation plan, every year in some universities in the country to recruit a certain number have walks graduate qualifications undergraduate course graduates, in the form of volunteer to be a teacher in the Midwest poor area middle school for a year. In 2003, the "college student volunteer service western plan" jointly launched by the central committee of the communist youth league, the ministry of education and other four ministries and commissions, recruits a certain number of fresh graduates from ordinary colleges and universities every year, and takes on volunteer service work including supporting education for one to two years in villages and towns of poor counties in western China.
            </p>
            <p>
                In view of the two plans, the state has also provided such services as keeping the student status of volunteers, retaining the status of fresh graduates, applying for extra points for postgraduates and giving priority to admission, and recognizing the work experience at the grassroots level during the service, so as to encourage volunteers to actively participate in public welfare and serve the western region. Whether it is the graduate support group of China youth volunteer poverty alleviation relay program or the university student volunteer service western program, most of them recruit excellent undergraduate students. Their volunteer groups are highly consistent with those of the public welfare organizations that are committed to long-term teaching projects represented by beautiful China. At the same time, after years of practice, education voluntary teaching organization has achieved remarkable results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, hong-yu liu suggested in the "proposal", according to "China youth volunteer ZhiJiaoTuan poverty alleviation relay planning students" or "western college students volunteer service plan" to support policy, strengthen the policy support for the education of public organization, for the social public welfare organization of qualified university student volunteers, volunteers provided include keeping one's status as a student, keep fresh identity, enter oneself for an examination points and preferences, enter oneself for an examination the graduate student during the civil servants preferential admit, admit services for the support of grassroots work experience, to attract and encourage more social organizations to participate in the precision in the education poverty alleviation this noble cause.
